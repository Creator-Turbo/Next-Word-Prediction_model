## Language Model – Next Word Prediction
![Dog vs Cat](next_word_pred.jpg)

## Overview
This project focuses on building a Next Word Prediction Model using a large dataset sourced from Wikipedia. The primary goal is to train a Language Model capable of predicting the next word in a given sentence or phrase based on contextual and linguistic patterns.

The model utilizes the power of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and interpret text data effectively. By learning semantic and syntactic patterns, the model delivers accurate predictions and demonstrates the utility of language modeling in tasks such as text generation, autocomplete systems, and chatbot implementations.



## Motivation
Language modeling is a critical aspect of NLP and forms the foundation of various advanced applications such as:

1 . Autocomplete functionality in search engines and messaging apps.
<br>
2 . Intelligent text editors like Grammarly or Microsoft Word's editor.
<br>
3 . Chatbots and conversational agents.
<br>
4 . Text generation models like GPT or similar AI tools.
<br>

This project serves as a hands-on implementation of creating a robust Next Word Prediction Model, providing insights into the underlying techniques, data processing, and model-building approaches.



## Technical Aspect

The project involves the following key technical steps:

Data Collection: Wikipedia data is used as the corpus, ensuring the model is trained on diverse and high-quality text.
Data Preprocessing:
Tokenization using tools like NLTK or spaCy.
Lowercasing, removing stopwords, and punctuation cleaning.
Model Building:
Sequential architecture using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for language understanding.
Embedding layers to map words into meaningful vector representations.
Training:
Use of categorical cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
Optimizer such as Adam for faster convergence.
EarlyStopping and Dropout techniques to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation:
Metrics like Perplexity to assess language model performance.
Deployment:
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
Host on platforms like Render, Heroku, or AWS.


## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/Dog-vs-cat-clf-

```
# Install dependencies: (all lib)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Run
To train the Deep leaning models:
 To run the Flask web app locally
```bash
python app.py

```
# Deployment on Render

## To deploy the Flask web app on Render:
Push your code to GitHub.<br>
Go to Render and create a new web service.<br>
Connect your GitHub repository to Render.<br>
Set up the environment variables if required (e.g., API keys, database credentials).<br>
Deploy and your app will be live!
